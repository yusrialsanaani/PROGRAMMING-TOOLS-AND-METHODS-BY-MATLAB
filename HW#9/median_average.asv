%median filter, which, as its name implies, replaces the value of a pixel by the
%median of the gray levels in the neighborhood of that pixel (the original value
%of the pixel is included in the computation of the median). Median filters are
%quite popular because, for certain types of random noise, they provide excellent
%noise-reduction capabilities, with considerably less blurring than linear
%smoothing filters of similar size. Median filters are particularly effective in
%the presence of impulse noise, also called salt-and-pepper noise because of its
%appearance as white and black dots superimposed on an image.
%The image processed with the averaging filter has less visible noise, 
%but the price paid is significant blurring.The superiority in all respects
% of median over average filtering in this case is quite evident. In general, median filtering is much better suited than averaging
for the removal of additive salt-and-pepper noise.
